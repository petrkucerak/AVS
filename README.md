# Embedded Systems Application

The course is intended for master's students of the study program Open Informatics and is opened exclusively in the summer semester. The lectures are focused on the design and application of embedded systems. The exercises are focused on the use of various components of embedded systems in cooperation with processors with ARM Cortex M3 cores.

Students are also familiar with digital signal processing to a basic extent. A total of 3 lectures and 2 laboratory exercises are devoted to this issue. STM32F4DISCOVERY development kits are available for practice.

The course presents the applications of embedded systems and their specifics. Proficiency in programming techniques is assumed, and the orientation of the course focused more on the description and explanation of blocks and functions of embedded systems. The aim is for the graduate of the course to gain an overview of functional capabilities, performance and peripherals, input-output, and communication blocks, which will allow him to orientate when choosing a microprocessor and microcontroller in the embedded system and its subsequent use and programming.
